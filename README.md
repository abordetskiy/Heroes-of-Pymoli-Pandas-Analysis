# Heroes of Pymoli - Analyzing data in a fantasy game

### This project pulls in data from a CSV file and uses Python and the Pandas library to analyze the microtransactions within the game to pull useful purchasing analysis and trends for the user. Included in the analysis are mulitple factors including Gender and Age demographics, top spenders, most popular and most profitable items.

## Also provided is detailed Analysis of observable trends show in the data:

1). It is very clear that the vast majority of those making purchases in Heroes of Pymoli are male. Interestingly enough, the average purchase price per person for non-male-category gamers is slightly higher than those of the male category. This may suggest a preference by non-male-category games to invest less often, but in higher priced items. This conclusion, however, is limited as there could also be anomalies due to the vast difference in population between these three groups. 

2). As expected, the age group table shows us a relatively normal distribution of gamers centered at 20-24 years old, with 15-19 year olds taking second place. Ironically, the youngest age group (<10) spent the 2nd most per item and per person. The most in both categories was 35-39, however the remaining age groups all hovered pretty closely around the $3 mark for average purchase price. The central 20-24 year old group also had the 3rd highest Average Total Purchase Price per person. With a neutral Average Purchase Price, this may actually suggest more multi-item orders in that age group.

3). Looking at the list of Top Spenders, it is worth noting that the top 5 spenders purchased less than 20 items totalling less than $75, meaning that we won't have to worry about 'power users' skewing our data. The Most Popular items and Most Profitable items lists were near identical, suggesting that those items are worth buying and priced well.
